Item Organization: Poosible allows businesses to organize their items efficiently. It enables the creation of categories, tags, and attributes for items, making it easier to navigate and search for specific products. This feature enhances the overall organization and accessibility of products within the system.

Customer Management: Poosible enables businesses to maintain a database of customers, including their contact information and purchase history. This feature helps businesses build stronger relationships with customers by providing personalized experiences and targeted marketing campaigns.
